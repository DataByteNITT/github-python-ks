# Project Management Tips

### We will look at some tips to make the whole programming experience fun.

Lets look at what we will do:

- Start from the bottom up, ie, look at the project first
    - Look at the of the requirements of the project.
    - Then set up the environment for the project.
- Figure out what dependencies you will use and set them up
- Set up your Environment with the plugins, settings and IDE's that you use
- **Actually start Working!!!!**


### Use a KanBan Style management board
- DEFINTION: a Japanese manufacturing system in which the supply of components is regulated through the use of an instruction card sent along the production line.
- We will use trello for our purposes. A quick view on how Trello looks like:

- We Use trello to manage our projects and assign activities to members and vice versa.
- To simplify the task, setting it up, We at databyte, have already set up a Trello board to get started.
- Just make a trello account and send in your usernames on our whastapp groups.

### Use Telegram, Slack, Gitter or some other similar service to communicate instead of conventional chap applications
- Chat Applications like Whats App are what they claim to be chat apps. While these may seem good, they are not very advanced to suit our needs.
- We need to pick a service that works well, and hasthe following features:
   - Content should be encrypted (obviously)
   - We can send files, and media easily
   - Should be cross platform as our environments can easily run across multiple platforms
   - Should some sort of automated system to inform us about important events from different services all in one place
   - examples would be commits, SMS texts, important announcements, etc
   - for this very purpose we use `bots` these can help us out easily
- For this we will use `Telegram` it is a messenger service that integrates these points very nicely, and will aid us in our work.

- #### Joining Telegram
    - To join telegram, as usual make an account on [Telegram](telegram.org).
