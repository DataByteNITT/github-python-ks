# <u>Some files we are going to work on</u>



Lets call it FILE `1`
<br>
* lets call `git init` in this folder to start our git repo.
* then call `git status`
* then call `git commit -m "Initial Commit"`


### Now that we have commited it, lets work some more on this file.

<p>	You will now see that this file is again staged for some changes again
	we repeat the same steps for our next commit.</p>

    Try calling your commit as "updated file1.md" 

<b>Remember!</b>, the commit messages must be short and informative.
